    "\n",
    "This is a summary report of an experiment I performed during my postdoc. The goal of this experiment was to identify a [molecular](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules) complex associated with Nrf1, a protein molecule we were studying. Nrf1 is also abbreviated NFE2L1, and should not be confused with Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We began studying Nrf1 because it resides on a [cellular organelle](https://youtu.be/URUJD5NEXC8) called the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). We study the ER and its roles in [metabolism](http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/metabolism/). We found that Nrf1 mediates the cellular response to cholesterol, and that it seemed to do this separately from its known function as a genetic transcription factor in the nucleus. Cholesterol metabolism occurs at the ER, and is very important in the liver, where cholesterol is metabolized and prepared for excretion. \n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesize that a group of other proteins interacts with Nrf1 to mediate its response to cholesterol at the ER. We used proteomics to test our hypothesis, which identifies all possible proteins in a sample with a technique called mass spectrometry."

The genetic material carried by the virus is incorporated into the mouse genome, and the protein is then produced by liver cells.

We used HEK-293 cells in this experiment as controls for Nrf1 and cellular compartments, and to evaluate antibody reactivity with human and mouse samples. The cells stably expressed Nrf1-HA, were treated with Epoxomycin (\"Epoxo\") to activate Nrf1, and were fractionated into microsomal (\"M\") or nuclear (\"N\") fractions.  There is less total protein in the microsomal fraction (lane 2), because HEK-293 cells only yield small amounts of ER, but it is still useful as a qualitative comparison.\n",

    "\n",
    "- We provided our samples to TCMP in IP elution buffer.\n",
    "- Gel\n",
    "    - The TCMP does a brief gel cleanup before mass spectrometry. Ryan claims this is helpful because the gel is agnostic to the elution buffer used to obtain the sample. However, a high protein concentration is required because of the small gel loading volume.\n",
    "    - After mass tagging, they then also do a 3 hour column separation prior to MS.\n",
    "    - If samples are divided among multiple runs (as ours were), include an internal “mix” standard for comparison. This is basically a small amount (5 μL) of all the samples mixed together.\n",
    "    - 30 μL of each sample was then loaded into a 10% Bis-Tris gel and run at 120V for 12 minutes.\n",
    "    - Gels were stained for 2 hours with Coomassie and destained overnight in water.\n",

    "- Enzyme digestion\n",
    "    - In-gel trypsin digestion was performed.\n",
    "- Tandem Mass Tagging\n",
    "    - Tandem Mass Tags (TMTs) are used to label primary amine groups. Ten different tags are available, allowing ten samples in the same mass spectrometry run. The tags are isobaric, meaning that they elute at the same time during LC, and have the same mass during MS1 acquisition, but after MS2 peptide sequencing, they fragment into unique ion masses during MS3 reporter ion quantification.\n",
    "- Mass spectrometry\n",
    "    - Peptides were resuspended in 5% Acetonitrile, 5% formic acid.\n",

    "\n",
    "<!-- TODO: re-do the data manipulation completely in R -->\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TCMP data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- MS2 spectra were searched using the SEQUEST algorithm against a Uniprot composite database derived from the mouse proteome containing its reversed complement and known contaminants.\n",
    "- Peptide spectral matches were filtered to a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) using the target-decoy strategy, for determination of incorrectly identified proteins, combined with linear discriminant analysis.\n",
    "- Proteins were quantified only from peptides with a summed signal to noise (SN) threshold of ≥200 and MS2 isolation specificity of 0.5, and do not include contaminants or reverse hits.\n",
    "- The TCMP provided an Excel workbook containing peptide counts (not sure if they are unique or total peptides), absolute and relative abundances of all proteins identified in the samples, and a PowerPoint report with methods and preliminary data analysis (hierarchical clustering performed in GENE-E, see below). They typically do not provide further assistance with data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### My data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no standardized way to analyze this type of mass spectrometry data, so I developed a custom data analysis pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was provided with the results in a Microsoft Excel workbook, so I performed some initial data preparation there for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps I performed were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalization**\n",
    "    - To compare results across multiple runs, I divided total summed signal to noise (or normalized relative abundance) for each sample by the corresponding value for the mix standard within that run.\n",
    "    - Note that this creates a ratio, and log2 transformation should be performed before further analysis.\n",
    "- **Filtration**\n",
    "    - I filtered the hit list to exclude proteins with ≤2 peptides quantified in all runs.\n",
    "    - Including only proteins with ≥2 peptides means the identification of the protein itself is confident, because multiple peptides corresponding to it have been identified, and that the identification of the protein is repeatable, because ≥2 peptides were detected in each mass spectrometry run. \n",
    "- **Transformation**\n",
    "    - I used log2 transformation.\n",
    "    - ∆Cholesterol=log2((HA chol/mix)/(HA cont/mix))-log2((HA cont/mix)/(lacZ/mix))\n",
    "- **Background subtraction**\n",
    "    - Background subtraction was not effective in these samples because protein abundance was greater in lacZ than HA in many cases. \n",
    "    - Proteins with an HA fold change (HA cont/mix)/(lacZ/mix)<1 could be excluded (meaning that the proteins were higher abundance in lacZ samples, without the tag we were pulling down). I kept them in for this analysis.\n",
    "- **T-tests**\n",
    "    - A fold change of 1.5 (log2=0.58) is commonly used as a threshold for biological significance.\n",
    "    - 33 proteins had ∆Cholesterol>0.58.\n",
    "    - T-tests were performed in Excel for convenience: `=TTEST(group1,group2,tails,type)`\n",
    "    - Data were sorted ascending to see significant hits.\n",
    "    - Significant hits were highlighted with conditional formatting.\n",
    "    - I performed ANOVA in R on the untransformed total summed signal\n",
    "to noise/mix values for all the significant hits. See [supplementary data](data-supplementary/R).\n",
    "\n",
    "Further details can be found in the [Mass spectrometry protocol](data-supplementary/BWS-proteomics-protocol.docx) and [electronic lab notebook entry](data-supplementary/R-proteomics-2016-Nrf1-Labguru.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "After normalization, filtration, transformation, background subtraction, and t-tests in Excel, I performed additional statistical analysis and plotting in R."
